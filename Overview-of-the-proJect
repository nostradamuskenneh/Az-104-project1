My Project
By: Oumar Kenneh
 
 
1: I firstly created azure active directory to create this project as instructed in the exam. Screenshot included.
2: I also created two virtual networks and peered them so that instances in the two virtual networks can talk to each other.
3: I create two VMs in both central us and south India and also deploy an application on them. I configure it with traffic manager to manage failover. 
4: I created a storage account followed by a container. Uploaded file in it for users to download it over the internet.
5: I deployed an application and placed an Azure loadbalancer in front of it to load balance my application traffic. I was able to monitor it by creating an Azure monitor and configuring it with my VMs.
6: I also deployed a highly available application capable of taking user input and I created a traffic manager and placed it in front of the application. The VMs were created from two different data centers. 
7: I created hub and spoke architecture. Where I configure gateway subnet, gateway firewall, route table to filter trafic coming and going out of my VMs. I also created three VMs in my hub and my 2 spokes to ping each other to see if it can ping each other.  
8: I was able to monitor my application by creating an Azure monitor and configuring it with my VMs.
